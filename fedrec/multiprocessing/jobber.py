class Jobber:
    """
    The Jobber class is a utility class that executes the pipeline and
    publishes the results. It handles job requests based on the job type
    and can also be extended to handle other job types.
    
    The job type and the job arguments are defined in the job request.
    The job request is a dictionary that contains the job type and the
    job arguments.

    Arguments
    ----------
    worker: BaseActor
        The worker object that is used to execute the job request. The worker
        is an object that is defined in the worker module.
    logger: Logger
        The logger object that is used to log the job request and the job
        response.
    com_manager_config: Dict (optional) default=None
        The configuration dictionary that is used to create the communication
        manager.
    
    Attributes
    ----------
    comm_manager: object
        Communication manager object that handles the communication
        between the jobber and the workers.
    comm_manager_config: Dict
        The configuration dictionary that is used to create the communication
        manager.
    logger: object of type Logger
        Logger object that handles the logging of the jobber. It is
        used to log the jobber's activity.
    worker: object of type BaseActor
        Worker object that handles the execution of the job request.
        It is used to execute the job request.
    
    Methods
    -------
    run()
        This method runs the jobs, and after this method is called, the
        Communication Manager listens to the queue for messages, executes
        the job request and publishes the results in that order.
    execute()
        This method takes message object and stores the job request to publish.
    publish()
        Publishes the result on kafka after executing the job request
    stop()
        This method is called after the end of a job request to perform cleanup
        and logging. It is called by the atexit function.
