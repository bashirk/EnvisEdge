    """
    EnvisAggregator is used to aggregate the results of multiple EnvisBase modules.
    By aggregating, we combine the results of multiple modules into a single result.
    For example, we can aggregate the results of multiple modules that are trained
    on the same data set. We can also aggregate the results of multiple modules that
    are trained on different data sets.

    Methods
    -------
    __call__():
        Aggregate the results of the modules.
    __repr__():
        Return a string representation of the object.
